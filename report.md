## Team Organization

The following subsections will detail our process for the team charter and mission statement. For the sake of
succinctness, everything else is consolidated into the appendix.

Refer to [Appendix A: Team Organization Assignment](/team207-s2024/assignments/teamorganization) 
for further information about our team organization and team decisions.

### Team Charter

The team decided on the charter fairly late, but eventually came to an agreement on what everyone wanted
for the group in terms of personal goals.

_Our goal is to gain knowledge in digital circuits that utilize serial communication. 
We as a team want this product to be compared to other professional grade devices being sold on the market._

### Mission Statment

After talking with eachother about one another's interests, the team began to determine what the project
needed to have as well as what each individual member wanted it to have. 

_The mission of the team is to create a sensor-based weather reporting product that is unique, portable, 
professional, reliable, and user friendly. It is something that should be focused on that a person can easily
use and install themselves, and is relatively simple to collect data from, along with contingency plans in case things go awry._
