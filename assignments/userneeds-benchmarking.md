    <td rowspan = "3"> There are a great number of weather stations on the market that provide a varying range of data. Finding one that targets what you need can be daunting if not exhausting by the time you do all the research. I depend on solar panels to power my home and needed a unit that, along with the basic weather data, could provide sun radiation readings to compare to the panel array performance. My aim was to find something easy to operate but still provide key weather data that was reliable, consistent and affordable. After researching the available units I purchased the Sainlogic 089. Keep in mind that any weather station won’t stand a chance of providing accurate data if you don’t follow the instructions. The user manual provided sufficient details (and pictures) to make the installation easy. We were up and running with a connection to an online weather channel within an hour. </td>

Overall it’s pretty accurate though the temperature does seem to go off a little bit in bright sun but not as much as some other weather stations I've had. The rain and wind are probably the most accurate I've had. I have it set up for 24 hour rainfall readings. It seems as though it just resets at midnight rather than doing a rolling 24 hours which makes it a little less useful. </td>

    <td rowspan = "3"> The setup on this product was fairly straightforward. Didn't have any problems there. What I've found is that the outdoor temperature is fairly accurate down to about freezing temperatures. Then it starts to diverge. By the time the temperature is in the teens, it measures 4 degrees warmer than it really is. The reason I know this is that I have two other already proven sensors strapped to the pole of the sainlogic and have observed consistent data supporting this conclusion. Because it doesn't measure 4 degrees difference across all temperatures, I can't add an calibration factor that the device allows. That is a nice feature by the way, but not useful in this case. </td>

    <td rowspan = "3"> I learned that you could spend a lot of money for one for a serious weather hobbyist, and probably get complexity that isn't wanted or needed. This little unit is GOOD, for a beginner who might want to move up later, and for someone who just wants to see a solid, basic weather system that gives a good introduction to reading the weather right at home. The receiving unit is well made, easy to read, and has buttons big enough for our arthritic old fingers. The manual is complete and easy to understand. Installation is quick and not complicated. I installed where my wife wanted it, wondering if it might suffer from electrical interference, and saw good steady readings on the meter that agreed with our other indoor/outdoor thermometers. The wind and pressure readings are fine, with the understanding that this old man is not about to place it high enough to escape wind interferences of our houses, or replace batteries when needed. </td>

Wind chill functions automatically when there is enough wind to change the “feels like” temperature, otherwise, the station displays “dew point” in that space. It took me awhile to figure that out. The manual does not tell you that. Also, I wish the “History” graphs were scalable. We don’t always have 75 mph winds. So, the graph mostly rests on the bottom. Not very useful. It would be nice to be able to scale this at will. Must downgrade by one star for the lack of explanation in the manual and lack of scalability in the weather history.

    <td rowspan = "3"> This weather station is just awesome. I was upgrading from an old Oregon Scientific (10+ years old) where the sensors were giving out and replacements unavailable. This does everything well, and the range is very good as well. I have mine on my desk across the house from the windows that face the devices in our back yard. The display is bright, colorful, and has loads of info on it. Setup was pretty easy, and it actually came with a printed manual... a rarity these days! I was intrigued with the ultra-sonic wind gauge (no moving parts) and it appears to be more accurate than my old one with a traditional cup anemometer. It took me some time to figure out how to set the Absolute (Station) and Relative (Sea Level) but once I realized the indoor temp/pressure unit displayed absolute always, it was easy to make the Hg to Mb conversion and adjust the settings for ABS and REL in the display.
I also got the lightning detector, but we haven't had any thunderstorms yet, so I have yet to see how it works. Totally happy with this purchase, and well worth going for the more expensive WS-5000. </td>

    <td rowspan = "3">  I had a Davis Vantage Vue that was accurate, reliable, built like a tank but the lack of being able to trend data, have any historical info didn’t exist. The very outdated console was also a big turn off. Now I’ve purchased the WS-5000. First impression was how small the components are compared to the Davis. Materials, especially ultrasonic wind and temp module seem vulnerable to bad weather events, we’ll see how they hold up over time. The not so good based on the high price of this station: No batteries included, no bird spikes included for rain cup, no battery back up for the console. Menu to set up the console proved a little frustrating as the learning curve on programming took a few minutes. Mounting: First the ultrasonic wind module has a wire for optional heating, it would be nice to be able to unplug this wire as I’m sure 98% of all purchasers won’t get this accessory. Instead you have to shove it in the mounting arm which makes it challenging to align the screw hole. I used a 10’ 1.25” aluminum pole mounted up on my shed. Hardware included was fine. So my sensor is now 18’ above ground and in an open space. Rain sensor, it’s only designed to mount at the top of a pole, very bad design as you want your wind sensor at the top. Really don’t understand this thought process. So now I can’t use the pole I had. Getting a second pole was not something I wanted to do. So I ended up mounting this on top of my garden structure about 6’ above the ground. Included hardware was fine. Also in the manual it notes a flashing led light at top of rain sensor indicates it’s sending a signal. On my example there was no indicator light. So either I got a sensor that this was missing or they haven’t updated there manual. You’ll see below the sensor worked, but made me question the quality of what I just purchased. Hardware and mounting I would give 3 stars, certainly room for improvement in options to mount. Time will tell if the components can withstand some minor hail and 100 degree days for months on end. The missing led indicator on the rain sensor was the only flaw that I noticed.Actual use of the system. Read the entire manual, plus one that a fully printed manual was included, something that is rare in todays world. I suggest you download there app and set up your account prior to starting this whole process. Of note it was at least one hour reading the manual and configuring the initial set up of the console. Rain and wind sensors were immediately recognized by the console, make sure to install the not included AA batteries into the sensors before turning on console. The display of the WS-5000 is 30 years forward of the Davis I had. The number of adjustments and ease of navigating once set up is best in class here. Major reason I switched out stations. Nice feature is the ability to turn off display so light it puts out at night doesn’t bother anyone. Major flaw though is no battery back up so when power goes out, which it will 2-3 times a year I’ll lose data and have to set it up again. Big omission in my opinion. That costs at least one star here. App: This is the best feature. You can see today, yesterday, last week, last month, with graphs for every measurement available and there are a lot! And at least you don’t have to pay a monthly fee. Although at this price your really paying up front. Overall after couple days of use: All measurements seem as accurate as the Davis. I will say the ultrasonic wind sensor is more accurate and picks up gusts that the Davis missed being mechanical vs. ultrasonic. Console is really nice but find I’m looking at the app much more frequently, this is do to all the extra data and trending graphs available, a good thing. I’m glad I made this purchase but hesitant on the long term durability of the components. I’ll come back after a year and provide an update. The only major flaw is the battery back up for the console, I knew before purchase this was the design. My only purpose in switching out was the ability to trend data and view status using mobil devices, this was a home run with this station. It’s very pricey but worth it if you want the most accurate wind data. If that is not as important many options at half this price are available. Update: June 2023 Less than a year of use and the outdoor temp sensor went bad, downgrading the rating as for the price this is unacceptable. Also without battery backup I’ve lost valuable data during storms, the very time you want to record max rain and wind. Update: Called Ambient for warranty, rude, condescending, talked over me. Must ship back at my expense, if they determine its bad they'll send one out, sometime, no time frame. Outdoor temp sensor is one part with ultrasonic wind sensor. What a poor design. Will never purchase anything from Ambient again. </td>

    <td rowspan = "3"> So I bought this unit when moving to a new house to replace my ws-1001 that always seemed to lose contact with Wifi. Now in new house with the 5000 and its the same issue. Seems that must be using a wifi antenna module from like 2005 and still havent updated it. ITs 2023 not 2005, I shouldnt be having these wifi issues. My wifi reaches 2 houses down in both directions and there is complete full signal where the console is. This is unacceptable. Before the wifi stopped working it also stopped reporting to Weather Underground directly. had to work around it by putting in the ambient weather webpage interface. But soon after the wifi stopped connecting and will not reconnect no matter how much you restart the router or the console.Another HUGE thing is the supposedly updated aenometer. Its supposed to be more accurate but is exactly the same as the cupped version. Complete snake oil BS. Final note. I have owned several ambient weather products and all have performed poorly or almost not at all. Do not buy anything from this company.  </td>

Upon inspection the top of the solar sensor was broken and let water into the unit destroying the electronics inside. Unit will no longer power up and isnt water tight.

There is a wall mount function. The display has dimming manually or auto dimming and the colors are very nice. It's easy to read the display from a distance. The display unit runs on a wall plug. They call the remote unit the "Outdoor", but I use it to monitor a travel trailer. The temperature updates about once per minute.

But with this one it's not an issue at all. Looking left, right, down are all very good. The looking up is not as good for some reason, but that's OK. Temp accuracy is good (compared it with other devices and weather apps), humidity accuracy - no idea if accurate. It has a great feature where it auto dims at night. You need to set to what hours you want it to be dimmed. It works great. Overall, very good product. Bought when it was half off. I wouldn't spend a full price on it.

    <td rowspan = "3"> Years ago, I pledged that I would not purchase another device with an LED color display. I went back on that promise with the purchase of this unit. I shouldn't have. In a normally lit room, but unit's display is too dim, even at its brightest setting. In addition, the angle of view is critical -- the unit seems to have been designed to sit on a desk or counter, where the viewer's eye is above the unit, but if you hang the unit on the wall, the digits are more difficult to read. This is especially true for the red digits (indoor temperature & humidity). This unit is okay in rooms that are less brightly lit. I have additional, more minor, complaints. The main unit's battery cover doesn't quite sit flush when closed -- the bottom of the battery cover extends a tad low. The documentation indicates that there is a "pull-out" stand to let the main unit stand up, but I couldn't find this stand. I found this unit on Amazon doing a search for atomic (self-setting) clocks, but this time-setting feature doesn't appear to be in this unit. Finally, I want to hang the unit on my wall, but there is no place on the back of the unit to do so. Well, there is a triangular recess for a screw head, but it's in the middle of the unit, and when you use this hole, and if the unit is plugged into an outlet, the unit is unbalanced, and the unit is tipped to the side a bit. One good thing -- the unit was able to read its remote sensor right away, and when I put the sensor out on the deck, it reacted to the change in temperature right away, despite being behind a few walls & doors. </td>

Lacrosse has terribly slow customer service. Hopefully someday the angels of their warehouse will send me a sensor so I can actually use the product I bought. But so far I've had a very non-committal email that still seems to assert the three separate packs of different manufacturer batteries all purchased new are somehow to blame for a defective unit. As I needed this device, I ended up purchasing a competing unit from vivosun that doesn't have as many features, but worked flawlessly out of the package (with the same batteries I attempted to use in this weather station). </td>

## Process of Organizing Needs

The group made a decision to begin processing the list of needs through a shared Jamboard for ease of use to add to over the weekend, on top of during the scheduled meeting time. A few of the ideas came from cannibalizing what was found through the VOC studies, but for the most part a lot of the needs were made impromptu. These upcoming lists would be extremely vital for the design ideation process. 

### Drafting Needs

The group began brainstorming needs on the Jamboard, throwing concepts at the theoretical wall to see what would stick. The board would be crucial in compiling a more solid idea with regards to what the group would want to do for this project.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 6: Finished Jamboard Page of User Needs</i>
</p>

### Grouping Needs

Once the set of needs was completed, the team began to group the needs in the following categories: Safety, Manufacturing, Hardware/Product Design, Customizability, Interactivity/User Experience, and Software Functionality. Note that many of the needs could have filled out multiple different sections, and it was up to the individual grouping them to discern the best one out of them.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 7: Finished Jamboard Page of the Groups of Needs</i>
</p>


### Ranking Needs

As soon as the needs were sufficiently grouped in a way all group members could agree upon, the lists were further organized by ranking each need in each category in order of importance- 3 stars for the most important, 1 stars for the least important.

</p>

</p>

### Compiled List of Needs

Finally, the group began the process of judging each need by an objective rank. While it was difficult to do, both from being an objectively tedious task as well as the layers of subjectivity for each group, it was necessary in order to decipher the best course of action going forward.
