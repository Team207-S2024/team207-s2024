# User Needs and Benchmarking

## Voice of the Customer Benchmarking

The team chose to begin figuring out what needs that the product would require to be 
successful by studying multiple other commercial products, and exhaustively note their 
pros and cons. With this knowledge written out, it would make the process of creating 
and organizing the user needs of this project significantly easier. The format was
 created in order to organize the data in as digestible way as possible.

| Mounting of the unit and set up was very straightforward. The outdoor unit is all one piece so you just have to attach it to the pole and mount it to something. The indoor unit connected to it very quickly. Setting up the indoor unit was quick and intuitive though I did read the instructions as I was doing it. It's been up and running for about 6 weeks and so far so good.  | The customer needs something that is easy to use.  |

| There are a great number of weather stations on the market that provide a varying range of data. Finding one that targets what you need can be daunting if not exhausting by the time you do all the research. I depend on solar panels to power my home and needed a unit that, along with the basic weather data, could provide sun radiation readings to compare to the panel array performance. My aim was to find something easy to operate but still provide key weather data that was reliable, consistent and affordable. After researching the available units I purchased the Sainlogic 089. Keep in mind that any weather station won’t stand a chance of providing accurate data if you don’t follow the instructions. The user manual provided sufficient details (and pictures) to make the installation easy. We were up and running with a connection to an online weather channel within an hour. | The customer needs a weather station that is targeted to their specific needs.|

| Installation was easy, and the mounting bracket, arm, and base give you lots of options for horizontal or vertical, on either a flat surface or on a pole. Since we had the last on up high on a pole above the fence, we did the same thing here is it worked out very easily. | The customer needs something that is easy to use.|

| This weather station features wind speed and direction, rain gauge, temperature, and humidity on the outdoor sensor; and temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure on the indoor display. Overall it’s pretty accurate though the temperature does seem to go off a little bit in bright sun but not as much as some other weather stations I've had. The rain and wind are probably the most accurate I've had. I have it set up for 24 hour rainfall readings. It seems as though it just resets at midnight rather than doing a rolling 24 hours which makes it a little less useful. | The customer needs a more accurate temperature sensor. |

| The setup on this product was fairly straightforward. Didn't have any problems there. What I've found is that the outdoor temperature is fairly accurate down to about freezing temperatures. Then it starts to diverge. By the time the temperature is in the teens, it measures 4 degrees warmer than it really is. The reason I know this is that I have two other already proven sensors strapped to the pole of the sainlogic and have observed consistent data supporting this conclusion. Because it doesn't measure 4 degrees difference across all temperatures, I can't add an calibration factor that the device allows. That is a nice feature by the way, but not useful in this case. | The customer needs a product that works in colder environments. |

| The other big complaint I have is that the anemometer stops working with accumulating snow. Yesterday we only received 2 inches of snow and it prevented it from working. The direction still works because that is not obstructed by accumulating snow, but the gust and average speed does not work until the snow melts. This is a poor mechanical design. I've owned other weather stations in this same home and they do not have this problem. | The customer needs a product that takes into account snowfall. |

| “Simple. Straightforward. Clearly presents the info I wanted to get wind readings from my porch. It's a fave. One caveat re "easy to use" was difficulty seating the battery. Sent the first one back because three people tried to seat the battery, and none of us could figure it out. Thought something must have broken. When replacement had same problem, I kept at it until I finally worked it out. You actually have to pull the clip back toward you, insert the battery, then push the clip back into place. Simple enough, but goes against all my experience (and that of my friends).” | The product is simple and easy to use for the user to manage. (explicit) |

| “great design that just needs to be held vertical in any direction, so you don't need to know exactly where the wind is coming from like other fan windmeters to get an accurate reading, has average and high wind readings, seams reasonably well constructed, the windmeter is a little larger than most other windmeters I have owned but the design is worth it.” | The product doesn’t require fiddling to get it to work as it’s meant to.

| I learned that you could spend a lot of money for one for a serious weather hobbyist, and probably get complexity that isn't wanted or needed. This little unit is GOOD, for a beginner who might want to move up later, and for someone who just wants to see a solid, basic weather system that gives a good introduction to reading the weather right at home. The receiving unit is well made, easy to read, and has buttons big enough for our arthritic old fingers. The manual is complete and easy to understand. Installation is quick and not complicated. I installed where my wife wanted it, wondering if it might suffer from electrical interference, and saw good steady readings on the meter that agreed with our other indoor/outdoor thermometers. The wind and pressure readings are fine, with the understanding that this old man is not about to place it high enough to escape wind interferences of our houses, or replace batteries when needed. | The customer needs a product that is easy to use (Latent) |

| I have had one for a few years and love it. I bought this one as a gift for my son-in-law. He loves it. The forecasting works great. He lives where it gets down to -40 and it still works. Just make sure you use lithium batteries for the outside unit. I gave it 4 stars because the display unit is not backlit. However it works so well that I would buy it again regardless. | The Customer needs a product that has good battery life (Latent) |

## Process of Organizing Needs

The group made a decision to begin processing the list of needs through a shared 
Jamboard for ease of use to add to over the weekend, on top of during the scheduled 
meeting time. A few of the ideas came from cannibalizing what was found through the 
VOC studies, but for the most part a lot of the needs were made impromptu. 
These upcoming lists would be extremely vital for the design ideation process.

### Drafting Needs
The group began brainstorming needs on the Jamboard, throwing concepts at the 
theoretical wall to see what would stick. The board would be crucial in compiling 
a more solid idea with regards to what the group would want to do for this project.

_Figure 6: FInished Jamboard Page of User Needs_

### Grouping Needs

Once the set of needs was completed, the team began to group the needs in the 
following categories: Safety, Manufacturing, Hardware/Product Design, Customizability, 
Interactivity/User Experience, and Software Functionality. Note that many of the needs 
could have filled out multiple different sections, and it was up to the individual grouping 
them to discern the best one out of them.

_Figure 7: Finished Jamboard Page of the Groups of Needs_

### Ranking Needs

As soon as the needs were sufficiently grouped in a way all group members could agree upon, 
the lists were further organized by ranking each need in each category in order of importance- 
3 stars for the most important, 1 stars for the least important.

_Figure 8: Finished Jamboard Page for Ranking Needs_

## Compiled List of Needs

Finally, the group began the process of judging each need by an objective rank. While it was difficult 
to do, both from being an objectively tedious task as well as the layers of subjectivity for each group, 
it was necessary in order to decipher the best course of action going forward.
