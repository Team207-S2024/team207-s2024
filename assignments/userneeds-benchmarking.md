# User Needs and Benchmarking

## Voice of the Customer Benchmarking

The team chose to begin figuring out what needs that the product would require to be successful by studying multiple other
commercial products, and exhaustively note their pros and cons. With this knowledge written out, it would make the process 
of creating and organizing the user needs of this project significantly easier. The format was created in order to organize 
the data in as digestible way as possible.

Finding one that targets what you need can be daunting if not exhausting by the time you do all the research. I depend on solar panels to power my home and needed a unit that, along with the basic weather data, could provide sun radiation readings to compare to the panel array performance. My aim was to find something easy to operate but still provide key weather data that was reliable, consistent and affordable. After researching the available units I purchased the Sainlogic 089. Keep in mind that any weather station won’t stand a chance of providing accurate data if you don’t follow the instructions. The user manual provided sufficient details (and pictures) to make the installation easy. We were up and running with a connection to an online weather channel within an hour.

Overall it’s pretty accurate though the temperature does seem to go off a little bit in bright sun but not as much as some other weather stations I've had. The rain and wind are probably the most accurate I've had. I have it set up for 24 hour rainfall readings. It seems as though it just resets at midnight rather than doing a rolling 24 hours which makes it a little less useful.

   <td rowspan="3" >The setup on this product was fairly straightforward. Didn't have any problems there. What I've found is that the outdoor temperature is fairly accurate down to about freezing temperatures. Then it starts to diverge. By the time the temperature is in the teens, it measures 4 degrees warmer than it really is. The reason I know this is that I have two other already proven sensors strapped to the pole of the sainlogic and have observed consistent data supporting this conclusion. Because it doesn't measure 4 degrees difference across all temperatures, I can't add an calibration factor that the device allows. That is a nice feature by the way, but not useful in this case.

   <td rowspan="3" >Simple. Straightforward. Clearly presents the info I wanted to get wind readings from my porch. It's a fave. One caveat re "easy to use" was difficulty seating the battery. Sent the first one back because three people tried to seat the battery, and none of us could figure it out. Thought something must have broken. When replacement had same problem, I kept at it until I finally worked it out. You actually have to pull the clip back toward you, insert the battery, then push the clip back into place. Simple enough, but goes against all my experience (and that of my friends).

   <td rowspan="3" >Very nice weather station for the money. Wind chill functions automatically when there is enough wind to change the “feels like” temperature, otherwise, the station displays “dew point” in that space. It took me awhile to figure that out. The manual does not tell you that. Also, I wish the “History” graphs were scalable. We don’t always have 75 mph winds. So, the graph mostly rests on the bottom. Not very useful. It would be nice to be able to scale this at will. Must downgrade by one star for the lack of explanation in the manual and lack of scalability in the weather history. Otherwise, I would buy this again and would recommend it to someone looking for a good value.

Thus far, I am happy with the other features & I particularly like the atomic clock. My other complaint is that at about $125,00, it is expensive compared to other makes. I chose it, because it does not need to be plugged in to have a clear display & I couldn't find another that had everything that this weather station has. I have only had it for two weeks so cannot state how durable it will be. My previous LaCrosse lasted for many years & I only had to change the batteries 2 or 3 times.

## Process of Organizing Needs

The group made a decision to begin processing the list of needs through a shared Jamboard for ease of use to add to over the weekend, on top of during the scheduled meeting time. A few of the ideas came from cannibalizing what was found through the VOC studies, but for the most part a lot of the needs were made impromptu. These upcoming lists would be extremely vital for the design ideation process. 

### Drafting Needs

The group began brainstorming needs on the Jamboard, throwing concepts at the theoretical wall to see what would stick. The board would be crucial in compiling a more solid idea with regards to what the group would want to do for this project.

_Figure 6: Finished Jamboard Page of User Needs_

### Grouping Needs

Once the set of needs was completed, the team began to group the needs in the following categories: Safety, Manufacturing, Hardware/Product Design, Customizability, Interactivity/User Experience, and Software Functionality. Note that many of the needs could have filled out multiple different sections, and it was up to the individual grouping them to discern the best one out of them.

_Figure 7: Finished Jamboard Page of the Groups of Needs_


### Ranking Needs

As soon as the needs were sufficiently grouped in a way all group members could agree upon, the lists were further organized by ranking each need in each category in order of importance- 3 stars for the most important, 1 stars for the least important.

_Figure 8: Finished Jamboard Page for Ranking Needs_

### Compiled List of Needs

Finally, the group began the process of judging each need by an objective rank. While it was difficult to do, both from being an objectively tedious task as well as the layers of subjectivity for each group, it was necessary in order to decipher the best course of action going forward.
