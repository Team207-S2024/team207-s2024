# User Needs and Benchmarking

## Voice of the Customer Benchmarking

The team chose to begin figuring out what needs that the product would require to be 
successful by studying multiple other commercial products, and exhaustively note their 
pros and cons. With this knowledge written out, it would make the process of creating 
and organizing the user needs of this project significantly easier. The format was
 created in order to organize the data in as digestible way as possible.

| Review  | Customer Need Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Mounting of the unit and set up was very straightforward. The outdoor unit is all one piece so you just have to attach it to the pole and mount it to something. The indoor unit connected to it very quickly. Setting up the indoor unit was quick and intuitive though I did read the instructions as I was doing it. It's been up and running for about 6 weeks and so far so good.  | The customer needs something that is easy to use.  |

## Process of Organizing Needs

The group made a decision to begin processing the list of needs through a shared 
Jamboard for ease of use to add to over the weekend, on top of during the scheduled 
meeting time. A few of the ideas came from cannibalizing what was found through the 
VOC studies, but for the most part a lot of the needs were made impromptu. 
These upcoming lists would be extremely vital for the design ideation process.

### Drafting Needs
The group began brainstorming needs on the Jamboard, throwing concepts at the 
theoretical wall to see what would stick. The board would be crucial in compiling 
a more solid idea with regards to what the group would want to do for this project.

### Grouping Needs

Once the set of needs was completed, the team began to group the needs in the 
following categories: Safety, Manufacturing, Hardware/Product Design, Customizability, 
Interactivity/User Experience, and Software Functionality. Note that many of the needs 
could have filled out multiple different sections, and it was up to the individual grouping 
them to discern the best one out of them.

### Ranking Needs

As soon as the needs were sufficiently grouped in a way all group members could agree upon, 
the lists were further organized by ranking each need in each category in order of importance- 
3 stars for the most important, 1 stars for the least important.

## Compiled List of Needs

Finally, the group began the process of judging each need by an objective rank. While it was difficult 
to do, both from being an objectively tedious task as well as the layers of subjectivity for each group, 
it was necessary in order to decipher the best course of action going forward.
