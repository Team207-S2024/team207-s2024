This is the most important part of our project, the Microcontroller. The Microcontroller that we have decided to work with is the PIC18LF26K40. We chose it mainly for its small amount of pins which helps with keeping our project simple and easy to manage. It also contains 2 MSSP ports. This is advantageous for us as it will allow us to run both SPI and I2C.
