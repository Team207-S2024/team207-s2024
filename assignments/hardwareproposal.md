Here is the current iteration of the team's hardware proposal. Each major part was made separately according to each individual subsystem, and then put together with one another in the final schematic. Many of the components were able to be imported from sites like Ultra Librarian, which definitely helped to speed up the process, but there were some that required custom symbols and footprints. 

An in-depth look for each part of the schematic will be shown below.
