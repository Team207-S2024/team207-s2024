# Software Proposal
  ![07-Software-Proposal drawio](https://github.com/Team207-S2024/team207-s2024/assets/157151171/1cf9c85b-175a-42b8-bdc6-fe0351766d09)

Shown in the figure above is a diagram of our software proposal. The diagram will provide an ample outline of our software design and what we wish to accomplish with each subsystem. The rest of the page will be dedicted to going more in-depth with each subsystem. 


## Microcontroller  
![Software main true](https://github.com/Team207-S2024/team207-s2024/assets/157151171/140d4266-cc05-446d-b7d4-ed13b9fd61fb)

This is our main software desing for the microcontroller. Our main loop will conssit of receiving data from all 3 subsystems, the humidity sensor, the motor driver, and the temeperature sensor. THe microcontroller wi;ll then use this data to decide its next decision.
