# Team Organization

## Team Goals

The goals for this project, and this team, were to be decided as the following:

* Create something unique and is versatile to many types of users.

* A product that is both aesthetically pleasing and feels safe to handle. 

* Make something that could feasibly be sold as a product. 

* Something that is broad enough for additional parts to be added onto it. 

* Something that all team members can be happy with.

Although these goals may shift and change in the future, the beginning points of this project had these overall goals that would be the basic building blocks for how the path of the project would go. 

## Product Mission Statement

The mission of the team is to create a sensor-based weather reporting product that is unique, portable, professional, reliable, and user friendly. It is something that should be focused on that a person can easily use and install themselves, and is relatively simple to collect data from, along with contingency plans in case things go awry.

## Communication Channels

Table 1: Team Member Communication Modes. Note that sensitive information is redacted as this is a public page. 

| Name  | First Choice | Second Choice | Third Choice | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Manuel Garcia | Discord | Email | Phone |
| Michaela De Angelis Werner | Discord | Phone | Email|
| Isaac D. Linares | Discord | Phone | Email |
| Jonathan Elijah Sales | Discord | 

## Communication Procedures
As each member had Discord as their first choice of communication, it’s to be assumed that most if not all correspondence
between the team will be done through a private Discord server created for this class, as well as sharing more miscellaneous
information and content that wouldn’t be necessary to share in the Google Drive or the GitHub. It’s also to be expected that 
each member will be capable of responding to one another in a timely manner, whether through Discord or the other methods of 
communication outside of class. If there are repeated failures of communication, it will be discussed in a group meeting to 
determine the best alternative for all parties involved. 

## Meeting Schedule

**Mandatory Meetings: ~4:30 - 6:00 PM on Mondays and Wednesdays.**
This seemed to be a free period for each person on average per week, and would allow for the group to work together on a 
standard basis outside of class. There can and will be exceptions to the starting time, in terms of officially starting 
an hour or so late in case people in the group will have prior engagements. 

## Roles and Responsibilities

Table 2: A list of roles and responsibilities that each member has currently pledged to.

| Role | Name | Duties |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Meeting Leader | Manuel Garcia | The meeting leader is responsible for scheduling meetings, and getting everyone on track with what needs to get done. Effectively, they will be the ones in charge of each meeting. |
| Project Manager | Michaela De Angelis Werner | The project manager is responsible for making sure that the project is advancing along the agreed-upon schedule, and reminding people of upcoming assignments that need to be done. |
| Assignment Manager | Isaac Linares | The assignment manager will keep track of and remind others of upcoming due dates. They will also make sure assignments are formatted correctly and handle submissions. |
| Meeting Recorder | Jonathan Elijah Sales | The meeting recorder, or logkeeper, is in charge of taking notes during meetings, and updating it with new notes for each meeting. |

### Role and Responsibility Accountability Procedure

While there are set roles for each person to accomplish, it’s to be expected that each member of the group will do their 
best to be responsible for their individual assignments and complete them in a timely manner without having to be repeatedly
reminded to either complete their work or to upload it to the Google Drive. Outside of the roles stated above, each person 
still has their own responsibility to their own work to complete on-time. 

## Team Coordination and Accounability

As stated previously, each person will be expected to be at least somewhat engaged in the Discord server and respond 
accordingly to what is being asked in it. It’s a requirement that each person attempts to contribute to group discussions 
when they come up in a productive manner, whether they be in-person or online. If a person is not being communicative or 
engaging in discussions, it will be brought up either in a meeting or in class in order to try and work with the person to 
see what the problem may be. If the person still does not participate, then the group will move on to the next section of 
conflict recognition. 	

## Conflict Recognition and Resolution

During team meetings the team will discuss with members that are not contributing to the project in terms of work, 
communication, or consistency. If a team member does not comply after the sit down meeting, then the team will talk 
with the instructor and issue a pink slip.
