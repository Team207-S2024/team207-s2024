## Team Goals

The goals for this project, and this team, were to be decided as the following:

* Create something unique and is versatile to many types of users.

* A product that is both aesthetically pleasing and feels safe to handle. 

* Make something that could feasibly be sold as a product. 

* Something that is broad enough for additional parts to be added onto it. 

* Something that all team members can be happy with.
